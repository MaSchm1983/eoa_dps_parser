# EoA_DPS_meter
First approach for a DPS meter for Echoes of Angmar (vanilla Version of Lord of the Rings online - Shadows of Angmar)
=======
## Usage:

- Download dps_parser.exe and config.ini
- Edit path to combat log files in config.ini 
- right klick on combat log chat window in lotro and select "start logging"
- use dps_parser.exe  

Should work in general. Window is free movable and combat logs up to 4 past fights beside the current one. Window can be resized in height, but actually not neccessary since few more analyzing steps are not implemented yet.
